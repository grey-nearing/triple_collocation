Hi Grey,
Attached are the core site matchup data files. The data columns are: year, time-of-year(UTC), WASM (core site vsm), SMAP L2SMP, ECMWF, SMAP-orbiting-mode (1=AM,2=PM). I think we should probably leave triple collocation out of this paper for now.
 
The core site names are:
Reynolds Creek (0401-36-01)
Walnut Gulch (1601-36-01)
TxSON (4801-36-01)
Fort Cobb (1603-36-01)
